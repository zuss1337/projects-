Language is a means of communication. 
We learn it in order to find new friends abroad and get acquainted with other cultures. 
Some of my friends have already moved to the USA and Canada
They often write me letters in English and I am glad that I can understand them without anybody's help.
This communication helps me to learn new English words and master my speaking skills.
